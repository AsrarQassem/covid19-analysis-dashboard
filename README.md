# COVID-19 Interactive Dashboard & Predictor  
An interactive COVID-19 data analysis dashboard and predictive modeling system built using Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and machine learning. The project visualizes global COVID-19 trends, processes large-scale datasets, and forecasts future case counts using regression algorithms.

---

## 🧪 Technical Summary
This system processes large COVID-19 datasets using Hadoop and Spark, visualizes key global statistics in an interactive dashboard, and predicts future case counts through a machine learning regression model. It combines distributed storage, fast data processing, and real-time data exploration to support insights into pandemic trends.

## 📖 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic produced massive volumes of data, making it difficult for the public and policymakers to interpret ongoing trends. This project addresses that challenge by creating a real-time interactive dashboard that displays global and country-specific COVID-19 statistics. It uses Hadoop HDFS, Hive, and Spark to store, clean, and process large datasets while employing supervised learning (linear regression) to predict future COVID-19 cases.

The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface with charts, graphs, and maps that simplify complex data. Predictions help anticipate upcoming spikes or waves, supporting decision-making for healthcare organizations, researchers, and the public.

## 🗺️ Architecture Overview

**HDFS → Hive → Spark Processing → ML Model → Dashboard Visualization**

### **1️⃣ HDFS – Data Storage**
HDFS stores large COVID-19 datasets and provides a distributed file system capable of handling big data efficiently.

### **2️⃣ Hive – Data Cleaning & Structuring**
Hive cleans, transforms, and structures the raw dataset. It converts unstructured CSV files into queryable tables using SQL-like commands.

### **3️⃣ Spark – Big Data Processing**
Spark reads the cleaned data from Hive/HDFS and processes it using fast, distributed computing. It prepares the dataset for analytics and machine learning.

### **4️⃣ Spark MLlib – Machine Learning Model**
Spark MLlib trains the regression-based machine learning model to predict future COVID-19 case counts.

### **5️⃣ Dashboard – Visualization Layer**
The dashboard visualizes processed data and prediction results using charts, graphs, and maps, making insights accessible to technical and non-technical users.
